2. Connect your Kindle to a computer via USB
3. Unzip the downloaded file (Make sure the name is KAnki) 
4. Copy the KAnki folder and the `kanki.sh` script to the `documents` folder on your Kindle
5. Open the `kanki/js/kanki_config.js` file and edit the configuration to match your language.
6. Download or convert a TTF font file that supports your target language. Rename it to `language.ttf` and place it in:
   ```
   kanki/assets/fonts/language.ttf
   ```
7. Disconnect your Kindle from the computer
8. Open the Kindle's home screen and run the KAnki app

## 🔧 How to Update ( New Users ignore this )

1. Back up your current `kanki/js/vocabulary.js` or `kanki/js/kanki_config.js` file if you have been using KAnki, ignore if you are a new user
2. Download the new KAnki release
3. Replace your old KAnki folder with the new one
4. Copy your vocabulary data to the new `kanki/js/kanki_config.js` file
5. Optional: Customize language settings in `kanki_config.js`
6. Copy your `language.ttf` font file to the new `kanki/assets/fonts/language.ttf` location
7. Disconnect your Kindle from the computer
8. Open the Kindle's home screen and run the KAnki app
9. Hit the `Reload` button after clicking the 3 dots in the top chromebar in the app to apply changes.
10. Done! Your KAnki app is now updated with the latest features including the new star/favorite functionality

**Note for users updating to the starred cards version**: When updating from a previous version without the star functionality, all your existing cards will initially be unstarred. You'll need to manually star your important cards after updating.

## Customizing for Your Language

KAnki makes it easy to study any language by changing just a few files:

### 1. Prepare the font for your target language

Download or convert a TTF font file that supports your target language. Rename it to `language.ttf` and place it in:
```
kanki/assets/fonts/language.ttf
```

### 2. Update the configuration file

Edit `kanki/js/kanki_config.js` to include your language configuration and vocabulary:

```javascript
/**
 * KAnki Configuration
 * Edit these settings to customize the app for your language
 */
var KANKI_CONFIG = {
  language: "Spanish",  // Change this to your language name
  levels: ["A1", "A2", "B1"]   // These should match the keys in your VOCABULARY object
};

/**
 * Vocabulary Data
 * Organized by proficiency level
 */
var VOCABULARY = {
  "A1": [
    {"front": "hello", "back": "hola", "notes": "Greeting"},
    // Add more words...
  ],
  "A2": [
    {"front": "tomorrow", "back": "mañana", "notes": "Time"},
    // Add more words...
  ],
  // Add more levels...
};
```

For languages with different writing systems, use the `reading` property:

```javascript
{"front": "こんにちは", "reading": "konnichiwa", "back": "Hello", "notes": "Greeting"}
```

## Web Editor for Flashcards by [Kindlemodshelfguy](https://github.com/NemesisHubris)

For an easy way to manage your flashcards visually, you can use the **KAnki Web Editor**:

- **Web Editor**: https://kindlemodshelf.me/editor.html

This online editor allows you to:
- Upload your existing flashcard configuration files
- Add, edit, and delete cards and decks through a user-friendly interface
- Preview how your flashcards will look on different Kindle generations
- Export your modified configuration back to your Kindle

## Converting to Anki Format

If you want to convert your KAnki configuration to Anki's `.apkg` format for the desktop/mobile Anki application, you can use the **KankiToAnki** converter:

- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/crizmo/KankiToAnki
- **Web App**: https://kankitoanki.vercel.app/

## Data Storage

KAnki saves your progress and card statistics using the Kindle's localStorage feature. All your data is stored locally on your device at:

```
/Kindle/.active_content_sandbox/kanki/resource/LocalStorage/file__0.localstorage
```

If you ever want to reset all progress or encounter issues with saved data, you can:

1. Delete this file to completely reset the application data
2. Use the "Reset Progress" button within the app to only reset card progress while keeping your deck intact
3. Use the "Reset All" button to return to the default deck and clear all progress

## Development
